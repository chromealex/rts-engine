# AGENTS.md — rules for coding agents working on RTSEngine

Read this file completely before changing anything. It is short on purpose. `README.md` has the
user-facing overview (in Russian); this file is the engineering contract.

## 1. What this is

A from-scratch C++20 engine for real-time strategy games (Warcraft, StarCraft, Red Alert, Dune II,
Total Annihilation, Age of Empires, Company of Heroes, They Are Billions, Northgard, Mushroom
Wars, lane battlers, ...). Targets: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, HTML5. No third-party engine.

**The engine is a fixed library of mechanics; games are data.** A game is a folder
`games/<id>/` with `game.json`, `rules.json`, `maps/*.json`, `ui/`, `models/`, ... Agents that
build *games* (through the editor or the MCP server) never touch engine code. Agents that work on
the *engine* add mechanics generically — never a special case for one game.

## 2. Layout

| Path | What | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `engine/core` | Fixed (Q47.16), Random (PCG32), Hash (FNV-1a), ECS (sparse sets) | sim-safe primitives |
| `engine/data` | JSON reader (comments allowed, numbers parsed as Fixed) | no floats in parsing |
| `engine/sim` | Simulation (lockstep tick, commands, events, checksums), Replay | deterministic |
| `engine/gfx` | RHI `Gfx.h`; backends `gl/` (GLES3, WebGL2, GL 3.3) and `metal/` | never call GL/Metal outside |
| `engine/render` | Renderer3D (forward, shadows, PCF tiers), shaders (GLSL + MSL in `Shaders.h`, `ModelShaders.h`), models (glTF/OBJ, `Model.h`), animation (`Animation.h`), ImGui layer, camera math | float OK; format: docs/models.md |
| `engine/platform` | Cocoa, UIKit, Android NativeActivity, Emscripten, Win32, X11 | `Platform.h` is the only API |
| `engine/assets` | fonts, default assets copied into every build | data only (no code: it is bundled) |
| `engine/atlas` | texture atlas manifest + `.rtex` pages, `TextureLibrary` (path -> texture + uv + trim) | packer in `tools/atlas` (host only) |
| `engine/pack` | resource packs `.rpak`: reader (`Pack`), writer (`PackWriter`, host tools only) | zstd, reproducible output |
| `modules/rts` | generic RTS gameplay: data model (`RtsData`), map/pathfinding (`RtsMap`), module (`RtsModule*.cpp`, `RtsEconomy`, `RtsUnits`, `RtsCombat`, `RtsWorld`, `RtsTriggers`), AI (`RtsAI`) | deterministic |
| `modules/rts/view` | presentation of the sim (shapes, terrain, fog, overlays) | float OK, read-only on sim |
| `apps/client` | the game executable | |
| `apps/editor` | editor: dockable windows (Scene, Game + device simulator, Hierarchy, Inspector, Tools, Project, Rules, Statistics, Agent, Console); `core/` = Workspace/MapDoc shared with the MCP server | new windows: docs/editor-windows.md |
| `tools/mcp` | `rtsmcp`: MCP server (stdio) for agents; forwards to the running editor | game data only, never engine code |
| `apps/headless` | bot matches, replays, CI | |
| `apps/modelview` | model viewer and type gallery (`--game`) through the real view | models agent |
| `tools/rtsbuild` | packager: macOS .app, iOS Xcode project, Android Gradle project, web, Windows | ships content as `content.rpak` |
| `tools/assetpipe` | build / list / verify / extract / diff `.rpak`, import foreign archives (`--json` for MCP) | |
| `tools/unpackers` | unpacker plugins for foreign archive formats (zip, tar, dmg, Warcraft WAR, Westwood PAK, Z PAC/RSC) | protocol: `tools/unpackers/PROTOCOL.md`; host tools only |
| `tools/importers` | importers of old games into game folders (`dune2/import.py` → 2D game: tiles + sprites), Westwood codecs | Python stdlib; output is external data |
| `games/*` | sample games | data only |
| `tests/tests.cpp` | unit + mechanics + determinism tests | must stay green |
| `third_party/` | vendored libraries with licenses | MIT/BSD/zlib/OFL/CC0/CC-BY only |

## 3. Non-negotiable rules

**Determinism (simulation = `engine/core`, `engine/sim`, `modules/rts` except `view/`):**
- No `float`/`double` anywhere in simulation state or logic. Use `Fixed`, integer math, `fxSqrt`.
- Randomness only via `sim.rng()`; never `rand()`, time, addresses, thread ids, `std::hash`, unordered containers iteration.
- Iterate in deterministic order (ECS order, sorted vectors, `std::map`). Tie-break by entity index.
- Never add/remove components or create entities inside `world.each<...>()` — collect, then apply after the loop. Destroy with `destroyLater`.
- Everything that influences outcomes must be hashed in `RtsModule::hashState`.
- Input reaches the sim only as `Command`s; invalid commands are ignored silently (never assert/crash).
- Presentation reads sim state and `SimEvent`s; it never writes into the sim.
- After touching the sim run the determinism tests and a headless bot match on every sample game.

**Rendering/platform:**
- All GPU work through `gfx::Device` (RHI). Every shader exists in GLSL *and* MSL in the same change.
- Must run on weak Android GPUs: every expensive feature has a quality tier (`ShadowQuality`, etc.).
- Content files are read via `platform::readContentFile` (works on Android assets, web preload, packs).
- No threads in code that runs on the web build unless guarded.

**Editor windows:** see `docs/editor-windows.md` (one class per file in `apps/editor/windows/`, `RTS_EDITOR_WINDOW`).

**Data model:**
- New mechanics = new optional JSON blocks on types/rules/maps, parsed in `RtsData.cpp`, with
  readable errors (`type 'x': unknown resource 'y'`). Old game files must keep loading.
- When a fixed block can't express something, extend the trigger system (`RtsTriggers`) instead
  of special-casing a game.

**Licenses/assets:** only vendor code/assets with permissive licenses and keep their license files.
Original assets of commercial games are never committed; importers read them from the user's own
copy and builds mark them external.

## 4. Build, test, verify

```sh
# Linux / CI
cmake --preset linux-release && cmake --build build/linux-release
build/linux-release/rts_tests                                   # all must pass
build/linux-release/rts_headless --project games/skirmish --seed 3   # must end with a winner
build/linux-release/rts_headless --project games/mushrooms --seed 3

# macOS (Xcode generator) / iOS
cmake --preset macos && cmake --build build/macos --config Release
build/linux-release/rtsbuild macos --project games/skirmish      # packaged .app in dist/

# Screenshot check without a display (Linux): any visual change must be looked at
Xvfb :97 -screen 0 1280x800x24 &
DISPLAY=:97 RTS_SHADOWS=medium RTS_SCREENSHOT=/tmp/shot.ppm RTS_EXIT_AFTER_FRAMES=300 \
  build/linux-release/RTSGame --map 0 --spectate
```

Environment knobs: `RTS_CONTENT` (content root), `RTS_SHADOWS=off|low|medium|high`, `RTS_AUDIO=off|null`
(null: real audio thread without hardware), `RTS_AUDIO_CAPTURE=mix.wav` (record what was played),
`RTS_SCREENSHOT`, `RTS_EXIT_AFTER_FRAMES`.

A change is done when: it builds without warnings on gcc/clang (`-Wall -Wextra`), tests pass, the
headless matches still finish, visual changes were checked on a screenshot, Metal code paths that
couldn't be compiled are listed in the commit message as unverified.

## 5. Working in parallel

Several agents work at the same time. **Each agent works in its own branch/worktree** and only in
its area. Need to change a file outside your area? Keep the change minimal, additive, and say so in
the commit message; prefer adding a new file over editing a shared one.

| Area | Paths | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Simulation & mechanics, AI, triggers | `engine/core`, `engine/sim`, `modules/rts/*.{h,cpp}` | main agent |
| Editor, MCP server, device simulator | `apps/editor`, `tools/mcp`, `docs/game-format.md` | main agent |
| Models, PBR materials, skinning, procedural animation | `engine/render`, `engine/gfx`, `modules/rts/view`, `apps/modelview`, `tools/models`, `docs/models.md`, `games/showcase` | models agent |
| In-game UI (RmlUi, HTML/CSS) | `engine/ui`, `apps/client`, `engine/assets/ui` | UI agent |
| Resource packs `.rpak`, build size/compression, unpackers/importers of foreign game data | `engine/pack`, `tools/assetpipe`, `tools/unpackers`, `tools/importers`, `tools/rtsbuild` | packs agent |
| Texture atlases (packer, manifest, runtime lookup) | `engine/atlas`, `tools/atlas`, atlas step in `tools/rtsbuild` / `tools/assetpipe` | atlas agent |
| Localization | `engine/i18n`, `engine/assets/lang`, `games/*/lang`, `tools/i18n`, `modules/rts/RtsLocalize.*` | i18n agent |
| Audio | `engine/audio`, `modules/rts/audio`, `tools/audiopack`, `third_party/miniaudio`, `third_party/vorbis`, `games/*/audio.json`, `docs/game-format.md` § audio.json | audio agent |
| 2D games: ortho camera, sprites, tile maps + autotile, tile tool | `engine/render/{SpriteBatch,SpriteShaders,TextureCache}*`, `modules/rts/RtsTiles.*`, `modules/rts/view/{Rts2DView.h,RtsSprites,RtsTileView,RtsCamera.h}*`, `apps/editor/core/TileOps.*`, `apps/editor/windows/TilesWindow.cpp`, `games/tiles2d`, `games/km2d`, `tools/art2d` | 2D-mode agent |
| Dynamic lighting (point lights, light map, flashes, night) | `engine/render/Lights.*`, `engine/render/LightShaders.h`, `modules/rts/view/RtsLights.*` | lighting agent |
| Platforms, device testing, CI (window/input/keyboard per OS, packaging templates) | `engine/platform`, `platform/`, `.github/` | platforms agent |
| Other areas | as assigned by the user | the agent the user assigned |

If your task is not in this table, the user's first message to you defines your area: write it
here in your branch (one row) so the integrator sees it.

Partial earlier attempts for models / UI / packs exist as branches `agent-models`, `agent-ui`,
`agent-rpak` (WIP, unverified) — you may look at them for ideas, nothing more.

Shared touch points and how to use them:
- `CMakeLists.txt`: add your sources in your own `add_library` block; don't reorder others.
- `tests/tests.cpp`: append tests at the end (before `main`), don't edit others' tests.
- `README.md`: add or edit only your own section.
- Sim → presentation: use existing `SimEvent`s; if you need a new event, ask the sim owner (or add
  it at the end of `GameEvent` in `RtsModule.h` and mention it in the commit).

## 6. Code style

- C++20, no exceptions in per-frame/per-tick paths (loaders may throw `std::runtime_error` with
  readable messages), no RTTI-heavy designs, no global singletons beyond platform state.
- Concise code; comments explain *why*, not what. Keep files focused (< ~1000 lines).
- Names: `camelCase` functions/variables, `PascalCase` types, `kConstant`, members `name_`.
- User-facing strings go through `i18n::Localization::tr()` with keys in `engine/assets/lang/en.json`
  and `ru.json` (see `engine/i18n/README.md`); never concatenate sentences. Code, comments, logs in English.

## 7. Commits

Small commits with a descriptive subject. Each message ends with:

```
Co-Authored-By: <agent/model name>
```

Mention unverified paths (Metal, Android, web) explicitly. Never commit build outputs (`build/`,
`dist/`) or files larger than 10 MB.
